**baud0wn** is a collection of mainly personal notes regarding different mostly technical topics. I use it to store templates and get reminders about how things work.

> e.g.: how do you create a file with predefined text from the console again? Visit [/baud0wn/linux/bash/](/baudown/linux/bash/#create-file-with-content) and find out!

It is a work in progress and gets constantly updatet, although I doubt it is of any use to anyone but me at this stage. But I'm already planning on converting baud0wn into a SPA and adding some neat features to it.

Things described in this personal documentation may be wrong or outdated. Please keep in mind that I'm not a native speaker. Corrections are always welcome!
